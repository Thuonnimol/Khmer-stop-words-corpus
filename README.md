Khmer stop-words corpus 2.0
Building process of Khmer stop-words corpus: Four steps below are used to generate 385 Khmer stop-words corpus.
1.	Direct translation: We translated word by word from the English stop-words corpus by using an English-Khmer dictionary. 
2.	Adding synonym words to corpus: While translating, we considered the synonym of the translated words.
3.	Manual adding Khmer Stop-words: Based on our experimentation in the Khmer Keyword Extraction method, we encountered some words which should be counted as stop-words, so we added those words into the corpus. 
4.	Word redundancy removal and cleaning: We removed redundancy words from the corpus.
